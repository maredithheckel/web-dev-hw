13. This entire HTML learning is new to me. I have never taking a web design course, but I am extremely thankful that I am. It has been challenging, but once I practice it I get the hang of it.
14. Next Topic we begin CSS and expand on styling, which helps us "decorate" HTML. Is there anything you're anxious or excited to learn about in this new section?
I am so excited to learn the new topic! Of course, I am a bit nervous because this is all so new to me.
15. I liked this assignment because it let me use all the tools we learned in HTML and apply them all at once.
