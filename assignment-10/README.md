1. I decided to look through the sample writings and I chose Harry Potter. Initially I wanted to do a really cool artsy font for the title, but couldn't find one I liked. Instead I chose 'Cinzel', serif; for my title. I though this was crisp, and stood out enough to be something J.K. Rowling would use for her novels. Then I chose a basic, nunito sans for my body because it didn't detract from the title, and had a nice flow.

2. What is the difference between a system font, web font, and web-safe font? What is the importance of having fallback fonts or a font stack?
A system font is one that is already downloaded onto your computer, a web font is one that is hosted on a server. A web-safe font is one that developers can count on being accessible by the system including: arial, georgia, times new roman, etc. Fallback fonts are the fonts that are used when the ideal font isn't accessible through the source.

3. Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.
I began by choosing a type of writing that interested me, which was Harry Potter. I then went into choosing my fonts and creative elements. I did become stumped when trying to use 2 fonts in my style sheet, but went in for help and figured it out!
