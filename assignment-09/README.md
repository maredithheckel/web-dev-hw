13. A universal selector is used to style every element on a page. Element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type, ie headings. Class selectors are a great way to select elements that serve the same function. ID selectors allow developers to define style rules by using a unique ID.

14. I decided to use 3 dark-ish colors. A deep red, blue, and purple. I feel like The 90s were either very bright or very deep. The codes for the colors are B45C76(180,92,118), 4E8FD1(78,143,209), (141,61,133).
