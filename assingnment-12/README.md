1. Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?
My imaginary client was one who has the travel bug. I included pictures of different places that I have traveled to. I thought it would be a good idea to link websites that I have found to be very useful for planning a trip; airline website, accomodations website and a website that listed travel reviews.
2. What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?
A display:block means that the element is shown in a block just like paragraphs and headers. A display:inline lets you choose the width and height of the element. Display: inline-block is similar to the display: inline with the exception of being able to respect the top + bottom margins/padding.
